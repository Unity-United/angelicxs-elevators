	USAGE
	To add an elevator, copy the table below and configure as needed:
		coords = vector3 coords of center of elevator
		heading = Direction facing out of the elevator
		level = What floor are they going to
		label = What is on that floor
		jobs = OPTIONAL: Table of job keys that are allowed to access that floor and value of minimum grade of each job
		items = OPTIONAL: Any items that are required to access that floor (only requires one of the items listed)
		jobAndItem = OPTIONAL: If true, you must you have a required job AND a required items. If false or nil no items are needed
